### Bandcamp Downloader

Uses Curl and Ruby.

To use the CLI script:

  - run the program with `ruby bandcamp_downloader.rb <url>`
                    i.e. `ruby bandcamp_downloader.rb http://fullemployment.bandcamp.com` (one of my bands).
  - all the tracks will be downloaded into a folder specified by the name of the band (i.e. fullemployment).
